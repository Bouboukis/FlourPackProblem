**Flour Pack Problem coding exercise**

You are given 2 kind of flour bags. 
Type A is 5 kilos.
Type B is 1 kilo.

You need to check if it is possible to make a packet out of them.
The bags need to be at least the weight of the packet, if it is more you must be able to make a packet of hole bags.
For example total Packet = 23 kilos, you have 5 Type A and 5 Type B then it is possible. 
If you have a total Packet again 23 kilos, but now you got 5 Type A and 2 of Type B you can not make a packet.
(5*5 + 2 > 23, (4*5 + 2) < 23)

Tricky exercise.
